# **App Name**: VerdantVerse

## Core Features:

- Data Import: Import plant datasets from local files to simulate a data server for initial setup.
- Manual Plant Data Entry: Allow users to manually input plant data, including species, germination needs, and optimal conditions.
- AI-Powered Plant Search: Use AI tool to identify plants from user input (e.g., name or description) and automatically populate relevant data fields.
- Condition Comparison: Compare local garden conditions (current and predicted) with the optimal conditions for each plant, highlighting viable options.
- Propagation Needs Display: Display specific germination and propagation needs for each plant based on imported/entered data.
- Publish Dataset: Feature that makes a given data set publicly available, read only. This will simulate a server that can deliver a single, published data set. No backend is necessary.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep green (#386641), evoking growth and nature.
- Background color: Very light green (#F0F5F1), providing a calm backdrop.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A68A64), used sparingly for calls to action and important information.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a readable, modern font for detailed plant information.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' to ensure a techy, scientific, crisp feel. This font works for headlines but should only be used for shorter text applications.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing plant types, environmental factors (sun, water), and growth stages.
- Subtle transitions and animations when displaying plant details and comparisons, enhancing user experience.
